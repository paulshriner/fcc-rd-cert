# freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certificate

These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc30aca8b2-d2c4-4009-a397-2e6d1ecbde3b/relational-database-v8) is my certificate on freeCodeCamp.

## Projects

### Celestial Bodies

A database of celestial bodies including galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and asteroids. The database was made using PostgreSQL, then data was inserted into it. Data was found from Wikipedia, Britannica, The Nine Planets, Little Astronomy, and The Planets. The data and relationships represented in the database may not be astronomically accurate as that was not the goal for this project.

### World Cup

A database of world cup teams and games. The database was made using PostgreSQL, then data was inserted into it from a csv file, and finally queries were made on the database. The data insertion and queries were done using Bash scripting.

### Salon Appointment Scheduler

A database for a salon including services, customers, and appointments. The database was made using PostgreSQL, and services were inserted into the services table. Finally, I made a Bash script to make an appointment for a customer (along with adding the customer if they weren't in the customers table).

### Periodic Table

A database for the periodic table including elements, properties, and types. A version of the database (using PostgreSQL) was given, from which I made several additions and corrections. Then, I made a Bash script to get element information based on atomic number, name, or symbol. When creating the Bash script, I used Git for version control.

### Number Guessing

A number guessing game. I made a PostgreSQL database to hold player info (username, games played, and lowest guesses). Then, I made a Bash script to get the player's username and challenge the player to guess a random number. When creatng the Bash script, I used Git for version control.

## Skills

- Bash
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## Development Tools

Development was done in a virtual Linux machine using the online platform Gitpod. VS Code and the necessary tools were preinstalled as set up by freeCodeCamp. The final files for each project were then uploaded to this GitHub repo.

## Running the Projects

I ran the projects through a Gitpod instance as facilitated by freeCodeCamp. However, it should be possible to run these projects locally, [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-run-freecodecamps-relational-databases-curriculum-using-docker-vscode-and-coderoad/) guide should provide a environment with the needed programs.
