# freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certificate

These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

* Celestial Bodies

      A database of celestial bodies including galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and asteroids. The database was made using PostgreSQL, then data was inserted into it. Data was found from Wikipedia, Britannica, The Nine Planets, Little Astronomy, and The Planets. The data and relationships represented in the database may not be astronomically accurate as that was not the goal for this project.

* World Cup

      A database of world cup teams and games. The database was made using PostgreSQL, then data was inserted into it from a csv file, and finally queries were made on the database. The data insertion and queries were done using Bash scripting.

* Salon Appointment Scheduler

      A database for a salon including services, customers, and appointments. The database was made using PostgreSQL, and services were inserted into the services table. Finally, I made a Bash script to make an appointment for a customer (along with adding the customer if they weren't in the customers table).
